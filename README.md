# WebDev-Internship-CodSoft

These are my projects for Web Development Internship at CodSoft. All these projects are related to front-end.
In this internship, I've built 3 projects in total including a landing page, portfolio website and a basic calculator using only HTML, CSS and Javascript.

During the internship, I've gained very much knowledge about web development especially on front-end development by doing these projects. And this helped me to gain some experience about web development.

I appreciate CodSoft for giving this opportunity to showcase my skills.
